    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I love Ramen. Instant, fresh, homemade, any of it! For a quick snack I like to take some instant ramen and make a few changes!</p>
        <p>The options are really endless, I'm just going with one of my favorites! Feel free to make it any way that you'd like!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Instant Ramen (Whatever flavor is preferred)</li>
            <li>One Egg</li>
            <li>Frank's Hot Sauce</li>     
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Follow instructions on your package of ramen.</li>
            <li> After the water is boiling, add some Frank's Hot Sauce. However much you'd like.</li>
            <li> Once the noodles are able to move around, add the seasoning packet and crack you egg into the broth. </li>
            <li> Sometimes I'll stir it all around immediately to make it look like a drop soup or leave the egg to poach in the broth!</li>
        </ol>
