        <p>
            Something I've been having since I was a young child, while maybe not the most healthy thing in the world it sure is delicious!

            It's simple to make, all you need is a microwave, plate, and paper towel. Oh! And of course some pepperoni!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bag of Pepperoni(Either 5oz or 8oz)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Take plate and line it with several layers of paper towel.</li>
                <li> Place pepperoni onto the plate. Spread it out so it is not in one big clump. If you'd like it crispier try to make it a single layer of pepperoni pieces.</li>
                <li> Depending on the size of bag you have, I find the 5oz. cooks well at 3 minutes. For the 8 oz. 4 minutes should be good. All microwaves vary though, so this will take some fine tuning to get it excatly how you want it.</li>
            </ol>
