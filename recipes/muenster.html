    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This one is the easiest of the bunch, but the tough part is getting the right block of cheese. It's usually pretty easy, but sometimes it's hit or miss!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Block of Muenster Cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This one starts in the store.<p>You need to get squeeze a few blocks and get the softest feeling one. I find these have the best texture.</p></li>
            <li>Once you have that perfect block home, slice it up and eat while still chilly. My favorite slice is right between thick and thin!</li>
        </ol>
